openssh (1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.7-pluribus1) trusty-security; urgency=medium

  * Fix authentication with TACACS+ via PAM when the TACACS server does not
    authorize before authentication
    - PAM is called even when the user cannot be found initially via
      getpwnam(). If PAM authenticates successfully then getpwnam() is
      called again. A success at this point allows the session through.
