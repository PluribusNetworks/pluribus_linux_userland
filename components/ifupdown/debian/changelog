      conffile may have a mismatch in the dpkg database and manually
      shuffle the file around on upgrade.  LP: #1217263.

    - Prevent the ability to stop or restart networking service

  * Dropped NetworkManager.conf support, the NetworkManager
    ifupdown:managed mode was never really supported and this causes quite a
    massive delta on ifupdown's side.
    If you do use that option at the moment, you will need to decide
    between managing the interface with NetworkManager (removing it from
    interfaces) or managing it with ifupdown (removing ifupdown:managed=true
    and the interface from NM).

    - If the /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file is present
      but doesn't have the "ifupdown:managed" the previous upload instructed
      the iniparser to return -1, which evaluates to TRUE. We instead instruct
      it to return 0, as we shouldn't prevent ifupdown from managing the
      interfaces in that case, as NM won't either. (LP: #281984)
    - debian/postinst: If the loopback interface is missing from the config
      in /etc/network/interfaces, add it on upgrade.
    - Add jobs and hooks for upstart.
    - Cherry-pick commit a1f8efc4d93f from upstream, add --no-scripts as a
      parameter to ifup/ifdown, allowing the user to bypass the the scripts
      in /etc/network/if-*.d/ (LP: #258782)
  * Don't include new /etc/default/networking as it's incompatible with event
    based networking configuration.
  * Don't bump dependency on initscripts as the dependency isn't required with
    the upstart jobs and the new version isn't in Ubuntu yet.
  * Drop our code hardcoding the metric at 100 for the default gateway,
    this was used to avoid conflicts between ifupdown and Network Manager.
    Nowadays Network Manager won't manage an interface defined in ifupdown
    and the rest of the metric changes are now in ifupdown.

  * Add autoconf/accept_ra options to inet6/dhcp (Closes: #676244).
  * Clean up after /run migration (Closes: #673057):
    - Remove old /etc/network/run.dpkg-old symlink.
    - Try to remove old /etc/network/run even if it's a symlink.
  * Depend on initscripts >= 2.88dsf-25 so mountnfs doesn't break.
  * Pass -q to sysctl to make the output less verbose.
  * Fix shell scripting mistake in /etc/init.d/networking (thanks to
    Stanislav Maslovski, closes: #678101).
  * Changes to interfaces exclusion:
    - Accept -X shortcut (wasn't working because of a bug).
    - Allow specifying more than one -X option.
    - Use shell glob syntax.
  * Add /etc/default/networking (Closes: #580035, #677973):
    - CONFIGURE_INTERFACES can be used to disable interfaces configuration.
    - Individual interfaces can be excluded with EXCLUDE_INTERFACES.
    - Extra verbosity may be requested with VERBOSE.
  * When ifup is being run with --force -n, always report errors regardless of
    ifstate.

ifupdown (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Accept duplicate options in /etc/network/interfaces, join them using
    a newline as a delimiter.
  * If an interface isn't defined, but mentioned in auto or allow statement,
    don't mention it in ifquery output.
  * Change shortcut for --exclude to -X (was -e previously).
  * Make ifquery return false if the interface isn't defined.
  * Fix typos in the changelog.
  * Calculate broadcast address internally.
  * Allow concurrent netmask specification in both address (using CIDR
    notation) and netmask for IPv6 (Closes: #674775).
  * Add preferred-lifetime setting for IPv6.
  * Pass -w and -e options to sysctl so we still can configure an interface
    even if IPv6 SLAAC options can't be set for some reason.
  * Port to GNU/Hurd (thanks to Svante Signell, closes: #296115).
  * Chdir to root when executing external programs (Closes: #361964).

    one or have used CIDR notation, hook scripts will have it properly
    specified in IF_NETMASK environment variable.
  * Declare Breaks/Replaces relationship against netbase << 5.0.
  * Merge changes from Ubuntu (thanks to St√©phane Graber):

ifupdown (0.7~rc1+experimental) experimental; urgency=low

  * Prefer isc-dhcp-client to dhcp3-client (also closes: #422885).
  * Let dhclient fail when no lease can be acquired (Closes: #420784).
  * Raise command-line options priority over /etc/network/interfaces
    (Closes: #657743).
  * Prevent aliases and VLANs from putting the main interface down
    (Closes: #656270).
  * Make iproute2 calculate the broadcast address (LP: #924880).
  * Shut udhcpc down correctly (Closes: #338348).
  * Update the rules according to /run migration.
  * Pass hardening flags from dpkg-buildflags (Closes: #661243).
  * Implement ifquery interface (Closes: #568479).
    - Make ifquery process mappings (LP: #850166).
    - Ensure ifquery always has no_act turned on.
  * Change --all behaviour:
    - If ifup or ifquery is called with the --all option, if doesn't just
      bring up all interfaces marked as "auto", but all interfaces of a
      specified class, "auto" by default. For most uses, this doesn't
      change anything, but lets all the interfaces of a specific class be
      brought up or queried.
  * Support cross-compilation, move Debian-specific things out of
    the Makefile (Closes: #666084).
  * Take networking init script over from netbase package.
    - Add reload action which reconfigures all interfaces currently
      configured.
    - Add LSB Description field.
    - Remove /usr from PATH.
    - Merge ifupdown initscript in.
    - Improve warning messages.
    - Don't use redirection hacks when parsing /proc/mounts and /proc/swap.
    - Document all supported subcommands.
    - On start, try to configure hotplug interfaces if they seem to be ready.
      Ignore errors if they fail to configure for some reason (for example,
      if the interface happens to be renamed by udev before it's fully
      configured).
    - Override Lintian's false positives.
  * Remove /etc/default/ifupdown.
  * Call hook scripts when processing all interfaces:
    - If ifupdown is called with the --all option, before or after doing
      anything to the interfaces, it calls all the hook scripts (pre-up or
      down) with IFACE set to "--all", LOGICAL set to the current class
      specified by the --allow option (or "auto" if it's not set),
      ADDRFAM="meta" and METHOD="none".
  * Fix IPv6 issue on kFreeBSD.
  * Update test suite.
  * Improve manual pages.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.
  * Also closes: #535226:
    - In 0.7~alpha5, "auto" method has been added.

  * Resynchronise with Debian experimental.  Remaining changes
    (LP: #905660, LP: #850566, LP: #611877, LP: #678425):
    - ifupdown.nw: Use 100 as default route metric unless an explicit metric
      parameter is set in /etc/network/interface.
    - Add iniparser3.0b sources (dictionary.c, dictionary.h, iniparser.c,
      iniparser.h), to let ifupdown avoid auto-up/down of interfaces if
      network-manager's ifupdown plugin is in managed=true mode.
    - Add a new query interface, 'ifquery', that can be used by upstart
      hooks to ask for the list of possible interfaces that they might need
      to bring up.
    - debian/ifupdown.network-interface.upstart: Replace the init scripts
      with a per-interface Upstart job.
    - debian/ifupdown.networking.upstart: Add a "networking" job that
      partially replaces the networking init script from netbase.
    - debian/control: Bump build-dependency on debhelper for Upstart-aware
      dh_installinit.
    - debian/rules: Due to debhelper always adding /etc/init.d symlinks, we
      must manually remove /etc/init.d/networking for as long as netbase
      still provides it.
    - Add if-up and if-down scripts to emit Upstart events when interfaces
      come up and go down.
    - debian/ifupdown.network-interface-security.upstart: Ensure apport is
      started before interfaces are brought up by either ifupdown or
      network-manager.
    - debian/postinst: If the loopback interface is missing from the config
      in /etc/network/interfaces, add it on upgrade.
    - debian/ifupdown.preinst: Since files in /etc were not conffiles in
      lucid, and /etc/network/if-up.d/upstart and
      /etc/init/network-interface.conf changed between lucid final and
      maverick, add extra handling to avoid spurious conffile prompts.
    - invoke dhclient3 with '-1', meaning it should exit failure if it does
      not receive a response in 60 seconds. (LP: #838968)
    - contrib/ifstate-check: Use /run/network/ifstate instead of
      /etc/network/run/ifstate
    - ifup.8: Update man page to indicate that Ubuntu uses /run
      and that it's always writable as it's a temporary filesystem
  * ifupdown.nw: When calling dhclient3, also use /var/lib/dhcp as
    dhclient3 is now a symlink to dhclient and /var/lib/dhcp3 no longer
    exists. (LP: #900234)

ifupdown (0.7~alpha5.1ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian experimental.  Remaining changes:
    - ifupdown.nw: Use 100 as default route metric unless an explicit metric
      parameter is set in /etc/network/interface.
    - ifupdown.nw: Add 'ipv4ll' method which uses avahi-autoipd to bring up
      an interface with an IPv4 link-layer address from 169.254.0.0/16 (aka
      'Zeroconf').
    - Add iniparser3.0b sources (dictionary.c, dictionary.h, iniparser.c,
      iniparser.h), to let ifupdown avoid auto-up/down of interfaces if
      network-manager's ifupdown plugin is in managed=true mode.

ifupdown (0.6.10ubuntu1) maverick; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian unstable, remaining changes:
    - ifupdown.nw: use 100 as default route metric unless an explicit metric
      parameter is set in /etc/network/interface
    - ifupdown.nw: Add 'ipv4ll' method which uses avahi-autoipd to bring up
      an interface with an IPv4 link-layer address from 169.254.0.0/16 (aka
      'Zeroconf').
    - Add iniparser3.0b sources (dictionary.c, dictionary.h, iniparser.c,
      iniparser.h), to let ifupdown avoid auto-up/down of interfaces if
      network-manager's ifupdown plugin is in managed=true mode
    - move ifstate file to /var/run/network/ifstate
    - Add a new query interface, 'ifquery', that can be used by upstart
      hooks to ask for the list of possible interfaces that they might need
      to bring up.
    - debian/ifupdown.network-interface.upstart: replace the init scripts
      with a per-interface Upstart job.
    - debian/ifupdown.networking.upstart: add a "networking" job that
      partially replaces the networking init script from netbase.
    - debian/control: bump build-dependency on debhelper for Upstart-aware
      dh_installinit.
    - debian/rules: due to debhelper always adding /etc/init.d symlinks, we
      must manually remove /etc/init.d/networking for as long as netbase
      still provides it.
    - Add if-up and if-down scripts to emit Upstart events when interfaces
      come up and go down.
    - debian/ifupdown.network-interface-security.upstart: ensure apport is
      started before interfaces are brought up by either ifupdown or
      network-manager.
    - debian/postinst: if the loopback interface is missing from the config
      in /etc/network/interfaces, add it on upgrade.
    - Fix a wrong path to examples in the interfaces(5) manpage.
  * Changes superseded in Debian:
    - ifupdown.nw: modprobe ipv6 before configuring it.
    - debian/control: Add missing ${misc:Depends}
  * Dropped changes:
    - Drop versioned dependency on netbase - no rationale is given for the
      dependency to exist at all.
    - No need to version the dep on lsb-base, every release since dapper and
      earlier satisfies this constraint.
    - Drop Breaks on old, pre-jaunty versions of udev.
    - Drop migration of "mapping hotplug" to "auto", this migration was done
      in hardy and upstream has dropped the debconf support so let's not
      readd it.
    - Drop edits to ifupdown-clean, no longer used in Ubuntu.
    - Drop the udev rules, which are now completely superseded by upstart
      jobs.
    - Drop preinst, postinst cleanup of the obsolete, Ubuntu-specific
      loopback script.
  * update all generated files to match their source versions (*.defn,
    main.c).

      a job that waits for two interfaces to come up.

      I still want this to be the default behaviour for "emit", and I do
      want this to block, but I need to fix Upstart first so that it doesn't

  (The above fixes the second ifup never completing due to waiting for
   network-interface-security to be restarted - which will never happen.)

ifupdown (0.6.8ubuntu8) gutsy; urgency=low

  * ifupdown.nw: use 100 as default route metric unless an explicit metric
    parameter is set in /etc/network/interface; this applies for static and
    dhcp interfaces and passes the -e IF_METRIC=%metric% option to dhclient{3}
    in order to accomplish this. For details see the launchpad bug
    (LP: #139403).

ifupdown (0.6.8ubuntu2) feisty; urgency=low

  * ifupdown.nw: Add 'ipv4ll' method which uses avahi-autoipd to bring up an
    interface with an IPv4 link-layer address from 169.254.0.0/16 (aka
    'Zeroconf'). See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZeroConfNetworking for details.

    - dhcp3 leases files moved to /var/lib/dhcp3

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 27 Nov 2006 13:16:58 +0000

ifupdown (0.6.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add myself as co-maintainer with approval from Anthony Towns.
  * Change path of dhclient.leases to make sure the dhcp state survive
    reboots. (Closes: #311777)
  * Change leasehours option value to match the option name. 
  * Async ifup/ifdown modication based on patch from Scott James
    Remnant and Ubuntu.  (Closes: #347580)
    - Rewrite the way that ifup and ifdown read and write the state
      file.  Instead of storing it in memory and holding a lock on it
      (preventing concurrent processes from actually being concurrent)
      use atomic read and write functions that only hold the lock for
      very short periods.
    - Write to the state file when we start bringing up or tearing
      down the interface, so we don't ever try to do the same
      operation at the same time.
    - Update the state file once the operation is complete to ensure
      we record the actual status of it.
  * Acknowledge NMUs. (Closes: #311011, #311443, #353154, #339834, #311928,

ifupdown (0.6.7ubuntu6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rewrite the way that ifup and ifdown read and write the state file.
    Instead of storing it in memory and holding a lock on it (preventing

    write functions that only hold the lock for very short periods.

  * Write to the state file when we start bringing up or tearing down the
    interface, so we don't ever try to do the same operation at the same
    time.
  * Update the state file once the operation is complete to ensure we
    record the actual status of it.
  
  * Restore the dhcp wait, so "ifup eth0" will hang around until DHCP is
    either successful or times out.  Adjust the udev rule again so that
    udevplug doesn't hang around.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 26 Jan 2006 15:56:54 +0000

ifupdown (0.6.7ubuntu5) dapper; urgency=low

  * Don't wait for dhcp to complete ... there's a general ifup problem that
    it doesn't have any state to record "I'm bringing this interface up",
    so no way to avoid multiple dhcp invocations for the same interface which
    end up blocking on each other.  This is a short-term hack until I sit
    down and think about this properly (probably next week at the sprint).

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 24 Jan 2006 18:04:53 +0000

ifupdown (0.6.7ubuntu4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Install new loopback init script at S:S08 which brings up the loopback
    (127.0.0.1) network device early enough for anything needing DHCP.  This
    also deals with creating /var/run/network if necessary.
  * Move /etc/network/run/ifstate to /var/run/network/ifstate
  * Drop the ifupdown and ifupdown-clean init scripts as everything they did
    is obsolete or already taken care of.
  
  * Ship a udev rule that brings network devices up or down if the device
    is marked "auto" in the configuration file.
  * Convert existing /etc/network/interfaces file with "mapping hotplug"
    lines to just use "auto" lines.
  
  * Adjusted "ifup -a" and "ifdown -a" to not report when interfaces are
    already up or down.

   [Javier Fernandez-Sanguino]
    - Added a generic --exclude option (modified ifupdown.nw and ifup.8)
      This way other scripts (such as /e/i/networking in netbase)
      can avoid bringing down 'lo' on shutdown doing: 'ifdown -e lo -a'
      This will help close #254705, #256680 and #208700.
    - Make it conflict with the dch-client version from experimental

ifupdown (0.6.4-4.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload. This is mostly a bug-fix release, no new
    features have been added and the behaviour of ifupdown has only changed
    slightly. Content has been reviewed by both the maintainer and several
    other maintainers (who have NMUed this package previously)
    - Ifupdown.dvi now depends on *eps files (Closes: #101204)
    - Added missing Build-Dep to noweb since the Makefile calls makenwdep.sh
      (and it calls 'noroots') on build.
    - Remove the undocumented (and unused) -s option from the manpage and the
      main.c code. (Closes: #231404)
    - inet6.defn
      + Make it possible to run an v4tunnel without an address (Closes: #96265)
    - inet.defn
      + Included different handling of dhclient3 versus dhclient.
      + Avoids inconsistency in interface state if the command run
       by ifup fails, also added -e option to dhclient in order to 
       have it return an error if it cannot get an address. 
       Notice that this is not yet done with dhclient3 (-1) since that would
       mean not running dhclient3 as a daemon and renews not being done.
       (Closes: #97782, #82339, #113338, #148666, #169194)
      + An independent lease file is created per interface so that dhclient
       can be used in more than one interface (Closes: #196366)
      + If dhcp3-client is installed (the binary /sbin/dhclient3 is available)
       then use the -r option instead of with a KILL signal, this enables
       it to release the DHCP release an execute the hook script before
       exiting. Also, the package now suggests 'dhcp-client | dhcp3-client'
       (since dhcp3-client does not provide dhcp-client as pump does)
       (Closes: #196865)
      + Added a metric option for routes, notice, however, the dhclient's
       -e (undocumented) option is not included from the provided patch.
       (Closes: #235993)
      + Use -r instead of -k when DHCP interfaces using pump are downed in 
       order to avoid killing all interfaces (only release the one asked for)
       (Closes: #198841)
      + Properly implement the 'hw' option in interfaces by defining the 
       hardware address before upping the interface. 
       (Closes: #224468, #84602)
      + Allow setting of the hw address in the dhcp method as suggested.
       (Closes: #135502)
    - examples:
      + Added an example in the interfaces file on how to setup an interface
       with multiple IP addresses. I've added a warning, though, since this
       is expected not to work in some cases and might generate inconsistencies
       between the real state and the one noted down in the interfaces state
       file. It is worth documenting this option (with known caveats) rather
       than have users figure it out for themselves.
       (Closes: #172147)
      + Added sample scripts ('ensureifup' and 'ifstate') to ensure that
       interfaces are always up (might be useful for crappy ISP providers)
       as provided by Yann Dirson (Closes: #86902)
      + Provide a 'generate-interfaces.pl' script under the examples dir
       in order to facilitate migration of network configuration in 
       pre-woody systems. This script might also be useful to migrate other
       Linux systems to Debian.
       (Closes: #57830)
      + Added a sample 'ifstate-complex' command. Since it is not documented
        I'm adding it to the examples and not closing #153222 with it (yet)
      + Fixed a syntax error in the 'check-mac-address.sh' script and added
        both a little bit of comment code and proper usage.
      + Provided an example on how to setup an interface without IP address
        using the 'manual' method. This is suitable for some cases where we 
        only want to have the interface to be up. This example can be used
        to setup PPPOE interfaces or network IDS listening on a network. 
        This might not be as good as providing a specific method but the
        maintainer considers that this is the way it should be handled.
        (Closes: #76142, #92993, #129003, #164823, #171981)
      + Also, provided an example bridge configuration script that can
        be setup in /e/n/if-{pre-up,down}.d/ in order to setup bridges.
    - Interfaces(5).pre:
      + Slight improvement in to better describe mapping and point to 
       the examples available. (Closes: #232594)
      + Minor changes in the manpage to avoid people being misled .
        (Closes: #232347)
      + Better description of mappings (Closes: #216716)
      + Document IFACE=LIFACE syntax (Closes: #213068)
      + Documented known bugs or limitations.
      + Reference the location of the network examples.
      + Reference also the "Debian Reference" manual since it is more
        verbose in how /e/n/interfaces and ifupdown works.
    - Ifup(8):
      + Document that the -a option will take down all interfaces.
       (Closes: #208607)
      + Also describe in which order are interfaces started/stopped when
        using -a which might avoid confusion, see  #208700 for example.
      + Changed manpage name to ifup (instead of ifupdown).
       (Closes: #81150)
      + Document known bugs in the manpage: state maintained is sometimes
       lost, the ifstate needs to be writable and there is a known deadlock
       issue.
      + Document known "limitations" and refer readers to alternatives to
        monitor interface changes such as ifupd and hotplug.
      + Minor formatting changes and rewrites for better comprehension.
    - Translations:
      + Added Spanish debconf translation provided by Carlos Valdivia.
       (Closes: #207727)
      + Added Japanese debconf translation provided by Kenshi Muto.
       (Closes: #210436)
      + Added Dutch debconf translation provided by Tim Dijkstra.
       (Closes: #213723)
      + Added Greek debconf translation provided by Konstantinos Margaritis.
       (Closes: #229503, #229527)
      + Added simplified Chinese debconf translation provided by Hiei Xu.
       (Closes: #231910)
      + Added Czech debconf translation provided by Miroslav Kure.
       (Closes: #231995)
      + Added Turkish debconf translation provided by Recai Oktas.
       (Closes: #239142)
      + Added Danish debconf translation provided by Morten Brix Pedersen.

ifupdown (0.6.4-4.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload
  * reinstate code creating non-existent /etc/network in preinst. Moving
    that code to postinst is currently problematic since other packages
    pre-depend on ifupdown and dpkg doesn't guarantee that pre-depended
    packages are configured before unpacking the depending package.
