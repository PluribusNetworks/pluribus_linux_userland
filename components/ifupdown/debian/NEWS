ifupdown (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The /etc/default/networking file is now read even when systemd is used,
  although its use is not recommended.

ifupdown (0.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  Ifupdown now comes with a systemd service file. Any options specified in
  /etc/default/networking will no longer be used. If you are using
  CONFIGURE_INTERFACES=no, then run "systemctl disable networking" instead.
  If you are using EXCLUDE_INTERFACES, then edit /etc/network/interfaces and
  remove those interfaces from any "auto" keywords.

  Ifupdown will now be more strict when errors occur, and will also properly
  return a non-zero exit code when (de)configuring an interface fails. Please
  ensure your /etc/network/interfaces is correct and that your interfaces can
  be brought up and down without errors, especially during system startup.

  Ifupdown now has more fine-grained locking, allowing concurrent calls of
  ifup and ifdown. It is also allowed to call ifup and ifdown from a (pre-)up
  or (post-)down line from /etc/network/interfaces, as long as no recursion
  occurs.

  You can now use the "inherits" keyword to copy settings from another
  interface stanza.

  RFC 4361 DDNS support is now enabled by default for inet dhcp interfaces if
  isc-dhcp-client is installed.

ifupdown (0.7~rc1+experimental) experimental; urgency=low

    The --all option to ifup and ifquery can now be combined with the
    --allow option to act on all interfaces of a specific class (still
    defaulting to the class 'auto'). If you have custom hook scripts, you
    may need to update them. See interfaces(5) for details.
