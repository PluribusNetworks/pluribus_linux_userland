Tools to manage "Boot Environments" on Ubuntu using the features
of the Btrfs filesystem. Boot Environments are essentially Btrfs
subvolumes and snapshots containing a complete root image and
can be booted into.

These tools were developed to support easy upgrade and rollback
for Pluribus Networks switches running with Btrfs filesystem and
are currently a little "raw", in that they make some assumptions
and have some fixed behaviour. These tools will be made more
general in future.

These tools assume an Ubuntu base with '@' as the root subvolume.
They also assume the presence of a directory called /.rootbe that
will have all the boot environments mounted.

The tools included are following:

1) beadm - A utility to create, delete, list and activate boot
           environments.
           Btrfs qgroups must be enabled for this to work properly.
           Boot Environment creation creates a writable snapshot
           of the currently booted root fs subvolume and creates a
           file in it so that the beadm script can differntiate it
           in future from other subvolumes.

2) apt-wrapper - A wrapper script over apt-get. This script detects
           an attempt to do "dist-upgrade" and does the following:
           * Create a new Boot Environment
           * Run "apt-get dist-upgrade" on the new Boot Environment
             inside a chroot.
           * Once dist-upgrade completes the new BE is activated.
           * Upon next reboot system boots into the new BE.
           Note that the current running environment is left untouched
           and continues to function normally while the upgrade is
           happening. 

3) btrfs_balance.sh - A script to do the btrfs balance maintenance
           with less impact to running processes and intended to be
           run frequently.
